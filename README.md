## Q-learning example repository
### Description
This repository uses the Phaser web game development kit along with a javascript implementation of the reinforcement learning concept of 'Q-learning'. 
The idea is that Captain Picard has gone quite mad in his lust for earl grey tea (what can I say, I'm a trekkie) and will gradually learn faster and faster ways to get to the tea.
You can see his progress on-screen, and observe the rewards he gets for each action he takes. Over time, he will learn to take the best actions to get to the tea as fast as possible.

### Installation Locally
